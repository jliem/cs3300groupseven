Demo Plan

D1 will consist of two executable deliverables, the CoLab server and the CoLab client. The CoLab server creates a new server using our custom-built application framework, populates it with some test data and waits for incoming connections. The server is designed to run from a terminal/console so while there is no GUI, the server will print a message when it has finished initializing successfully.

The CoLab client application presents a GUI to the user prompting for a server IP, username and password. The user logs in using an existing username/password pair (for D1, this is part of the test data pre-populated by the server). The client program connects to the CoLab server using RMI and authenticates whether the username/password combination is correct. If the user is authenticated successfully, the client displays a list of communities of which the user is a member (pre-populated by server) as well as a button to join a community. The user selects a community from the drop-down list and clicks the button to select and join that community. When the button is clicked, the CoLab client presents a new GUI representing a chatroom lobby, where the user has a window with chat messages and an input box. By typing text in the input box and clicking a button to send, the user's text is sent to the server, then relayed to all CoLab clients connected to this community's lobby.

In addition to the functionality described above that will be displayed during the demo, the deliverables for D1 will also include the channel and community framework used by our client and server.
