CoLab uses a class hierarchy where a Channel object represents the concept of a CoLab channel--for example, a chatroom, a document editor, or a whiteboard. Therefore, each Channel object is self-contained and holds all data necessary to re-create the exact state of that channel at a given moment. The CoLab framework also contains a Community class, representing a CoLab community with a list of channels and users who are authorized to view the data. The CoLab framework contains two structuring classes responsible for holding this channel and community information--ChannelManager and UserManager. ChannelManager stores information about Channels, and UserManager holds information about all communities and their users.

In D1, the CoLab server does not support any data persistence. However, later deliverables will include the ability to save and retrieve data for channels and communitites. Data storage will probably be implemented using XML files so that the data can be edited easily outside of the CoLab application.
