**CoLab** is a network-enabled utility for communication, brainstorming, and collaborative document authoring. It is centered around a basic chat-room style environment, and is enhanced with inclusion of several tools to facilitate idea sharing within small groups.

These tools include a collaborative document editor and whiteboard drawing tool.
Users create and join communities which are hosted on a single server.  All of a community's related data is stored on a server for this application, including revisions of documents, saved drawings, and chat logs.

Within a community interface, users can open multiple editors in new channels and co-author documents simultaneously.  For example, several people may be working on a diagram in the drawing tool while discussing it in a text chat.
